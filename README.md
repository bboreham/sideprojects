# Bryan's side-project ideas

The need for this repo came up when we had a "hackathon week" at work and I didn't have a good project to enter with.
I come up with ideas for side-projects all the time, but generally forget
them quickly, or jot them down in some Note app that I then also forget.

Each idea is in an issue.  If you'd like to implement the idea, or you already
implemented it, leave a comment!
